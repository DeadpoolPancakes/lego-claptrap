## The Idea

The basic idea behind this project was to make an autonomous robot. Having a look around and seeing what parts were to hand, I quickly came to the conclusion that using lego as  a base for the prototype would be a great idea. Firs thing first was to make sure I could build a tracked robot out of lego that would actually be able to move itself. I had seen examples of this before but i fancied having a go myself.

## The Prototyping

I started with two of the power function [M motors](https://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-Power-Functions-M-Motor-8883), One was taken out of the [Helicarrier](https://github.com/DeadpoolPancakes/lego-helicarrier). I built a very simple frame using parts from an arctic set that was stored away. Once the frame was completed it was time to install the motors and a control system. Using the lego motors, IR Sender/Receiver and a battery pack, I had a very simple remote control tank base.

The next step was a lot of research in to how tank tracks work and best design practices.

## The Idea

The basic idea behind this project was to make an autonomous robot. Having a look around and seeing what parts were to hand, I quickly came to the conclusion that using lego as  a base for the prototype would be a great idea. Firs thing first was to make sure I could build a tracked robot out of lego that would actually be able to move itself.

## The Prototyping

###### Mk1

I started with two of the power function [M motors](https://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-Power-Functions-M-Motor-8883), One was taken out of the [Helicarrier](https://github.com/DeadpoolPancakes/lego-helicarrier). I built a very simple frame using parts from an arctic set that was stored away. Once the frame was completed it was time to install the motors and a control system. Using the lego motors, IR Sender/Receiver and a battery pack, I had a very simple remote control tank base.

Now i had a basic test bed to see what sort of speeds and maneuverability i could get out of the tank platform.

#### Results of Testing

* Needed more motors. Initially the bot was very slow and only having one motor on each track was causing problems
* More clearence needed. This was a design flaw on my behalf as i rushed to put something together
* Not very durable. Although lego itself is tough, My design was not

###### Mk2

After testing the Mk1 and figuring out a the flaws of my initial design it was time to get started on the next version of the frame. Sticking with lego the base doubled in width and length. At this point only two motors were availbe so the speed suffered on this model.
